Name: Kubernetes Batch | Siva Reddy

Project should be success
Client should get money

Parameters
--------------
perfomance
less cost
resources optmisation
scalability
reliability
fast provisioning
security --> Good
immutable

Deliver the application asap
less defects

SDLC --> Software development life cycle

Requirements
Design
development
Deployment
Testing
Maintainance

Problem --> we will have solution

tech now may defnitely have some challenges, we will the challenges with new tech with new version or tech

continous development in software technologies

WATERFALL MODEl
----------------
1990's

2 years of time to deliver this application

development
1 year over then we get seriousness
then we start development

deployment --> DEV and QA

testers --> some testing

defects --> re development again

deployment into PROD

lot of errors

type of errors
---------------------
1. Development errors i.e related to functionality
 through testing we need to find these errors before clients does
2. Build and configuration errors --
	not able to connect database
	firewall errors
	server memory is less

DEV, QA, PERF, UAT, PRE-PROD, PROD
--------------------
Buy a server
Install OS
n/w and firewalls
install few packages and dependencies
application server --> JRE, .NET, Python
install application

Agile Technology
----------------------
Sprint-1 = 2 weeks
--------
SignUp and Login

1st week development
2nd week deployment and testing

DEV, UAT, PRE-PROD
------------------
Build
Testing
Deployment

Ask for your client to test

1 --> 5 defects
100 --> 20 defects

1. development errors
2. build and configuration errors

collect feedback

Sprint-2 product catalogue
------------------------
1. new development
2. address the defects in previous sprints





sprint-n
------------------
lot of testing
addressed many errors and feedback
perfect project


DevOps = Process improvment in Agile
----------------------
whatever you develop for the any day deploy it and test it

FirstName -----------

Build, deploy  this and test this

1 defect, easy to fix

number of testing cycles are increased exponentially
14 times
Projects more success

Physcial Server vs Virtualisation vs Containerisation
=====================================================
Frontend --> HTML, JS, CSS
Backend --> JAVA, .NET

REST API

amazon frontend
amazon backend --> user, cart, 
A single problem in website can make entire project down.

Microservices
-----------------------
modules/components
--------------
User project is different -> API --> JAVA
cart project is different --> .NET
payment is different --> Python
order management is different

Development can be in multiple languages

Project is very small
-------------
Containerisation
--------------
get base OS --> official vendors [bare minimum]
install few packages and dependencies
application server --> JRE, .NET, Python
install application
Image
Container

create image = base OS + system packages and dependencies + application run time + application
Ship image into multiple environments --> Container

Immutable, build once and run anywhere

configuration related erros will be addressed because of immutable nature
--------------------

=========================================================================================
Session-2 Agenda
----------------
Create Security Group
Launch EC2
Connect through Putty and Super putty
Install Docker in EC2
Docker commands

Container is the running instance of docker image
Container - mini server

docker images --> will show the images available in the server
docker pull <name>:<version> --> will pull the image from docker hub
docker create <image-id> - create container out of image
docker ps - will show running containers
docker ps -a --> will show all containers
docker start <container-id> - will start the container
docker stop <container-id> -> it will stop the container
docker rm <container-id> -> delete the container
docker rmi <image-id> - will remove images


docker run = docker pull + create + start
docker run by default runs the container in foreground attaches to the screen
docker run -d
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
docker run -d -p <any-host-port>:80 nginx
netstat -lntp --> all used

i want to login to the nginx container and see what is there inside

docker exec -it <ID> bash
CTRL + D to come out



assign one port on host that should map the container
